# 9 Levers of Value (9 LoV)

KPMG framework for comprehensive business value analysis across Financial Model, Business Model, and Operating Model.

## When to Use

- Business analysis or strategic review
- M&A target evaluation or synergy assessment
- Due diligence (commercial, operational)
- Value creation planning (PE, corporate development)
- Identifying improvement opportunities

## Critical Pattern

**Operating Model levers (7-9) are systematically overlooked.** Without this framework, analysis skews heavily toward Financial/Business Model while ignoring:
- Governance and risk controls
- People and culture transformation
- Incentive alignment

These "soft" levers often drive the most sustainable value.

## The 9 Levers

## Deployment Checklist

When applying 9 LoV, explicitly address ALL 9 levers:

- [ ] **Lever 1**: Financial Outcomes - vision, priorities, targets
- [ ] **Lever 2**: Markets - geography, competition, regulation
- [ ] **Lever 3**: Propositions & Brands - products, pricing, brand
- [ ] **Lever 4**: Customers & Channels - segments, profitability, GTM
- [ ] **Lever 5**: Core Processes - automation, outsourcing, efficiency
- [ ] **Lever 6**: Technology & Infra - systems, data, facilities
- [ ] **Lever 7**: Org/Governance/Risk - structure, controls, tax/legal
- [ ] **Lever 8**: People & Culture - leadership, skills, culture change
- [ ] **Lever 9**: Measures & Incentives - KPIs, targets, incentive alignment

## Red Flags

If you're thinking any of these, STOP:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a quick analysis" | Quick analyses benefit most from structure |
| "Levers 7-9 don't apply here" | They almost always apply; you're skipping hard work |
| "I'll just focus on financials" | Financials are outcomes; levers 5-9 drive them |
| "Culture stuff is fluff" | Culture eats strategy for breakfast |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Skip levers 7-9 as "soft" | These often drive most sustainable value |
| Treat as linear checklist | Levers interact; note dependencies |
| Surface-level sub-lever coverage | Use sub-lever questions as prompts |
| Ignore non-financial outcomes | Stakeholder value increasingly important |
| Miss incentive misalignment | If incentives don't match strategy, strategy fails |
