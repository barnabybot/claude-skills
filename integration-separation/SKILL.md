# Integration & Separation Execution (EDGE 3.0)

This skill covers the EDGE methodology for M&A integration and separation execution, based on KPMG's global best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning or executing a **post-merger integration**
- Planning or executing a **carve-out or divestiture**
- Assessing **Day 1 readiness**
- Designing **Transition Service Agreements (TSAs)**
- Tracking **synergies** or **stranded costs**
- Setting up **Integration/Separation Management Office (IMO/SMO)**
- Developing **Target Operating Model (TOM)**

## The EDGE Framework

### 5 Phases (Same for Integration & Separation)

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬─────────┐
│ Deal        │ Pre-Sign    │Pre-Close│ Day 1       │ Stabilization│Optim/BAU│
│ Analytics   │             │         │ Cutover     │              │         │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┼─────────┤
│ LOI         │ Sign        │         │ Close       │              │         │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┴─────────┘
```

| Phase | Timeline | Integration Focus | Separation Focus |
|-------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **1. Pre-Sign** | LOI → Sign | DD, execution approach, synergy hypotheses | Standalone cost assessment, separation blueprint |
| **2. Pre-Close** | Sign → Close | TOM design, synergy planning, Day 1 prep | TSA structure, entanglement mapping, stranded costs |
| **Day 1** | Close | Cutover execution, legal control | Cutover execution, legal separation |
| **3. Stabilization** | Close + 30-90d | Quick wins, tracking, employee retention | Quick wins, TSA stabilization |
| **4. Optimization** | 90d+ | Long-term synergy capture | Stranded cost reduction, TSA exit |
| **5. BAU** | 12-18mo+ | Lessons learned, playbook update | Full independence |

## Phase 1: Pre-Sign

### Key Activities

| # | Activity | Output |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1.1 | Financial Diligence | Quality of earnings, working capital |
| 1.2 | Commercial Due Diligence | Market position, customer concentration |
| 1.3 | DD Support (Separation) | IRL requests, data room, Q&A |
| 1.4 | Standalone Cost Assessment | Stranded cost base, TSA scope |
| 1.5 | Confirm Strategic Intent | Deal rationale, value drivers |
| 1.6 | Develop Execution Approach | Timeline, readiness assessment |
| 1.7 | Mobilize Execution Program | IMO/SMO setup, governance |
| 1.8 | Communications Plan | Announcement strategy |

### Execution Readiness Framework (5 Dimensions)

| Dimension | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Objectives & Priorities** | Are deal objectives clear? Are success metrics defined? |
| **Governance** | Is governance structure defined? Are roles clear? |
| **Capability & Capacity** | Does the team have skills and bandwidth? |
| **Stakeholder Management** | Are stakeholders identified and engaged? |
| **Tools & Methods** | Are frameworks, templates, and tools ready? |

### Guiding Principles Checklist

Define and document principles for:
- [ ] Execution timing and speed (aggressive vs. measured)
- [ ] Decision-making authority (ESC vs. IMO/SMO vs. Workstreams)
- [ ] Organizational design approach (acquirer model vs. best of both)
- [ ] Technology strategy (consolidate vs. maintain separate)
- [ ] Employee retention priorities
- [ ] Communication frequency and transparency
- [ ] Synergy/stranded cost accountability

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Close

### Key Activities

| # | Activity | Integration | Separation |
|---|----------|-------------|------------|
| 2.1 | Kickoff & Governance | IMO setup, workstream charters | SMO setup, workstream charters |
| 2.2 | Operating Model | Target Operating Model (TOM) | As-Is → To-Be, entanglement mapping |
| 2.3 | Value Tracking | Synergy opportunity list | Stranded cost register |
| 2.4 | Day 1 Readiness | D1R plan, cutover checklist | D1R plan, cutover checklist |
| 2.5 | Taskplans | Detailed workstream plans | Detailed workstream plans |
| 2.6 | TSA Design | TSAs from target | TSAs to buyer, RTSAs |
| 2.7 | Reporting | Execution scorecard | Execution scorecard |

### Governance Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                Executive Steering Committee (ESC)       │
│         Strategic decisions, issue escalation           │
└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
