# 10 Productivity Tips That Actually Work

After years of trying every productivity system under the sun, I've narrowed down what actually moves the needle. Here are the strategies that have stood the test of time.

## 1. Time Blocking Your Deep Work

The single biggest improvement I made was scheduling dedicated blocks for focused work. No meetings, no Slack, no email. Just deep, uninterrupted concentration on one task.

Start with 90-minute blocks in the morning when your energy is highest. Protect this time like your most important meeting—because it is.

## 2. The Two-Minute Rule

If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. This simple rule from Getting Things Done prevents small tasks from piling up and cluttering your mental bandwidth.

The mental overhead of tracking tiny tasks far exceeds the effort of just doing them.

## 3. Weekly Reviews Are Non-Negotiable

Every Friday afternoon, I spend 30 minutes reviewing what I accomplished, what's pending, and what needs attention next week. This habit alone prevents the Sunday anxiety that comes from uncertainty.

## 4. Batch Similar Tasks

Context switching is the productivity killer. Group similar activities together: all calls in one block, all writing in another, all administrative work in a third.

Your brain needs time to load the right mental models for each type of work.

## 5. Design Your Environment

Your physical space shapes your behavior. I keep my phone in another room during focus time. I have a dedicated workspace that signals "work mode" to my brain.

Small environmental changes compound into massive behavioral shifts.

## 6. Learn to Say No

Every yes is a no to something else. Protect your time by developing a framework for deciding what deserves your attention. Ask: "Does this align with my top priorities?"

## 7. Use Implementation Intentions

Don't just set goals—specify when, where, and how you'll execute. "I will write for 2 hours at my desk after my morning coffee" is far more effective than "I should write more."

## 8. Energy Management Over Time Management

You have the same 24 hours as everyone else. The difference is how much energy you bring to each hour. Prioritize sleep, exercise, and nutrition as productivity tools, not luxuries.

A tired hour is worth a fraction of an energized one.

## Conclusion

Productivity isn't about doing more things—it's about doing the right things with full engagement. Start with one or two strategies from this list and master them before adding more.

What's your most effective productivity tip? I'd love to hear what works for you.
