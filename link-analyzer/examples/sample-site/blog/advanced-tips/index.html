        UNDER-LINKED EXAMPLE:
        This page only receives 1 inbound link (from getting-started).
        The home page links to it too, so actually 2 inbound.
        With threshold=3, this is under-linked.
        
        It also doesn't link to other internal pages (except nav),
        which limits its contribution to link flow.
